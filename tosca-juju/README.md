tosca-juju
==========

This directory contains a prototype of a TOSCA to Juju converter, written in python,
that can consume a TOSCA Cloud Service Archive (CSAR) and convert it into Juju
Charms, so that the corresponding application can be deployed via Juju.

The current implementation is compliant with the TOSCA v1.0 Community Specification
Draft 03 (CSD03), and requires Chef implementation artifacts.

Disclaimer
----------
The prototype code is not actively maintained at the moment and for
illustrative or reference purposes only.
